Assignment 2: Forces

To spin each pole, use keys x,c,v,b,n,m (these must be assigned as hot keys in the inspector for each pole).
To push and pull the pole, you must hold down the key above that goes with the pole, and press either minus (-) or equals (=).

When ball crosses into goal box, the camera resets to its original position; press spacebar to launch new ball.

Use the arrow keys to navigate camera during game.


NOTE: I had a lot of trouble making a rotational hinge for the poles as opposed to a pendulum-like one in our class example.
For this reason, after spinning the poles, they begin to shake and it was something that I couldn't figure out how to debug.
